The result is dependent on the magnetic ion species. By default, a first order form factor f is returned. If the keyword g_lande is given a numerical value, then a second order form factor F is returned.\n\nIt is traditional to define the form factors using a sum of Gaussian broadening functions in the scalar variable s = k4œÄ, where k can be interpreted as the magnitude of momentum transfer.\n\nThe Neutron Data Booklet, 2nd ed., Sec. 2.5 Magnetic Form Factors, defines the approximation\n\nlangle j_l(s) rangle = A e^-as^2 + B e^-bs^2 + Ce^-cs^2 + D\n\nwhere coefficients A B C D a b c are obtained from semi-empirical fits, depending on the orbital angular momentum index l = 0 2.

However, one may also directly create a structure factor by providing a System to StructureFactor. Then, to manually generate a sample, the user must ensure that the spins of their system are drawn from an appropriate equilibrium distribution and call add_trajectory! function. This process may be repeated as necessary to generate a sufficient statistics. \n\nThe keywords specify all the parameters used in subsequent calculations and must be determined at the time that the StructureFactor is initiated. Specifically:\n\nŒît: Sets the step size of the integrator used to calculate trajectories.\nœâmax: Determines the maximum resolved energy.\nnœâ: Determines how many energy bins to resolve between 0 and œâmax. If set   to 1, Sunny will calculate a static structure factor.\napply_g: Determines whether to apply the g-factor when calculating   trajectories.\nops: Enables an advanced feature for SU(N) mode, allowing the user to   specify custom observables other than the three components of the dipole. To   use this features, ops must be given an N√óN√ónumops array, where the   final index is used to retrieve each N√óN operator.\nmatrix_elems: Allows the user to specify which correlation functions are   calculated. This is specified with a vector of tuples. By default Sunny   records all auto- and cross-correlations generated by the x, y, and z   dipolar components. To retain only the xx and xy correlations, one would set   matrix_elems=[(1,1), (1,2)].\nprocess_trajectory: Specify any preprocessing that should be applied to a   recorded trajectory before calculating correlations. By default, no   processing is applied. Options are :symmetrize, which symmetrizes the   trajectory, and :subtract_mean, which subtracts the mean value.

The choice :dipole restricts each a spin to an angular momentum dipole. In contrast, the choice :SUN describes each spin as a full SU(N) coherent state, where N = 2S + 1. The SU(N) approach captures more dynamical degrees of freedom, e.g.,  quadrupolar moments S·µÖS·µù+S·µùS·µÖ. Finally, the choice :projected projects the SU(N) dynamics onto the space of dipoles.
